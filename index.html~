			<div class="detail">"Any organization that designs a system (defined broadly) will produce a design whose structure is a copy of the organization's communication structure." (Melvin E. Conway)</div>
			<p>I'm a self taught software developer with 7+ year of experience (5+ years remote). I initiated my studies with SuperLogo at the age of 10, and I won a mathematical championship in national student contest. Because I wanted to be a hacker, I learned HTML, JavaScript, CSS, PHP and MySQL.</p>
			<p>I started to work as a intern in IT department of technical school until I've enlisted as privated at army, in the communication platoon and IT sector. Afterwards, I worked, as a freelancer, at Workana and had other clients, which helped me to improve my skills, mainly in OOP, ER, ORM and CRUD. Then, I work as civil servant both state executive and state judiciary, in software developer role, and learned a lot about project management, business analyses, QA and best practices, team work, IT infrastructure, deployment, change management and Oracle database. Plus, I developed a lot the mentoring skills as new colleagues arrived and organized the knowledge of the team in a database. Besides, I'm learning even more Python for automation, programming and machine learning.</p>
			<p>I love Software Development. Plus, I really enjoy programming thinking for organizing the knowledege to solve real-world problems and making easy to manage this knowledge. Because of it, I am pursuing a Bachelor degree in Law. For me, the sources and logic is very important for both Law and Software Development, from technical wokr to business rules. Also, I am started to understand the TDD, DDD and BDD approaches to improve the Software Engineering. Futhermore, I have the entrepreneur spirit and participated in several Hackathons, winning the 2nd place in "Use of AI in alternative justice for repetititve demands" and 4th place in "Use of OpenBanking for validate demand and reduce risk". Moreover, I practicing my English conversation with natives.</p>

				<div class="block">
					<div class="title">Programmer, Court of Justice of Rio Grande do Sul</div>
					<div class="detail">Apr 2019 &mdash; Present</div>
					<p>At the department of financial systems, I was the mainly responsible for incidents and software development of Scheduler and Selo.</p>
					<p>Scheduler is an ETL system for banking integration payment of expenses, deposits, payment order, marsharl payment and others with 40K payments per month, with average of 30M Brazilian reais (5,3M dollars).</p>
					<p>Selo (the Portuguese word for stamp) is a fiscal system for tax collection of private registry office and refund and other legal payment, with 800 user. The main challenge was the lack of documentation and the security issues.</p>
					<p>My solution was to propose an smart documentation infrastructure (code as infrastructure) for self update as the system evolution and report for security office every issue I found.</p>
					<p>Other challenge was unreadable and not abstract code and not normalized database structure, spoiling the potential of intelligence and accurate of data of very critical operation because of the problem of bigger effort than invoice. The solution that I propose was the refactoring of the system part by part.</p>
					<p>I also worked with the Distribution module of Selo which is a complex routine that calculates the compensation value for Exempt Services and Minimum Income. I develop a solution for real-world problem using math.</p>
					<p>Because of Corona Virus Pandemic, the job changed to remote and I developed the pair programming culture in this context.</p>

					<div class="detail">Apr 2018 &mdash; Mar 2019</div>
					<p>At the network and support department, I was the mainly responsible for digital signature process, critical for the eletronic judicial process. There was a misunderstood of the working of RSA signature system, for instance, the confunsion between private and public key, or the confusion between key and certificated. Because of my mathematical knowledge of assimetric encryption system using prime number theory, it was easy for me to explain the credibility of RSA system for my colleagues. Also, I test a lot of applications of digital sign and repport for my chief the security issues of Shodoo (application developed by Labor Regional Court) that it led to the prohibition of use this applications at that office.</p>
