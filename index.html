			<h1>Profile</h1>
			<h2>"Any organization that designs a system (defined broadly) will produce a design whose structure is a copy of the organization's communication structure." (Melvin E. Conway)</h2>
			<p>I'm a self taught software developer with 8+ year of experience (5+ years remote). I started my studies with SuperLogo at the age of 10, and I won a mathematics championship in national student contest. Because I wanted to be a hacker, I learned HTML, JavaScript, CSS, PHP and MySQL.</p>
			<p>I started to work as a intern in IT department of technical school until I've enlisted as private in army, in the communication platoon and IT area. Afterwards, I worked, as a freelancer, at Workana and had other clients, which helped me to improve my skills, mainly in OOP, ER, ORM and CRUD. Then, I work as civil servant at both state executive and state judiciary, in a software developer role. In this job, I learned a lot about project management, business analysis, QA and best practices, team work, IT infrastructure, deployment, change management and Oracle database. Plus, I developed a lot the mentoring skills as new colleagues arrived and I organized the knowledge of the team in a database. Besides, I'm learning even more Python for automation, programming and machine learning.</p>
			<p>I love Software Development. I really enjoy programming thinking for organizing the knowledege and to solve real-world problems. Because of it, it drew my attention the importance of the rules in software development, avoiding the possibility of make mistakes. Also, the rules of softare must observe the business rules. Besides, the rules of a software contain its knowledge. So,I realized the importance of mastering the understanding of rules and I started pursuing a Bachelor degree in... Law! Now days, I think that I did the right choice because just a ordened system can survive in the chaos of distributed systems.</p>
			<p>This understanding of rules, led me to start to understand the Test, Data and Behavior Driven-Development (TDD, DDD and BDD) approaches to improve my Software Engineering skills. For example, in a summer course, I developed a Data Driven application for computer graphics, with stand-alone math equations, like a configuration file. Futhermore, I have the entrepreneurial spirit and participated in several Hackathons, winning the 2nd place in "Use of AI without bias in justice for repetitive cases" and 4th place in "Use of OpenBanking to validate creditworthiness and reduce loan's risk". Moreover, I practicing my English conversation with natives speakers.</p>

			<h1>Employment History</h1>
				<section class="block">
					<h1>Programmer, Court of Justice of Rio Grande do Sul</h1>
					<h2 class="detail">Apr 2019 &mdash; Present</h2>
					<p>At the department of financial systems, I was the mainly responsible for incidents and software development of Scheduler and Selo. Scheduler is an ETL system for banking integration for payment of expenses, deposits, payment order, marshal payment and others with 40K payments per month, with average of 30M Brazilian reais (5,3M dollars). Selo (the Portuguese word for a notary seal) is a fiscal system for tax collection from private registry office, refund and other legal payment, with 5M stamps/month and 800 users. The main challenge was the lack of documentation and the security issues. My solution was to propose an smart documentation infrastructure (code as infrastructure) for self updating as the system evolved. Also I reported, to security office, 14 issues I found.</p>
					<p>Another challenge was unreadable and non abstract code and non normalized database structure, spoiling the potential of intelligence and accuracy of very critical operation because of the problem of bigger payable than receivable. The solution that I propose was the refactoring of the system part by part.</p>
					<p>I also worked with the Distribution module of Selo, which is a complex routine that calculates the compensation value for Exempt Services and Minimum Income. In this context, I developed a solution for real-world problem, using mathematics, that nobody else had solve.</p>
					<p>Because of Corona Virus pandemic, the job changed to remote and I developed the pair programming culture with new colleagues in this context.</p>

					<h1>IT Technician, State Attorney General's Office of Rio Grande do Sul</h1>
					<h2>Apr 2018 &mdash; Mar 2019</h2>
					<p>At the network and support department, I was the mainly responsible for digital signature process, critical for the electronic judicial process. There was a misunderstanding of the working of RSA signature system, for instance, the confusion between private and public key, or the confusion between key and certificate, or the confusion between cryptgraphy and digital signature process, or the confusion between electronic signature and digital signature. Because of my mathematical knowledge of assymmetric encryption system using prime number theory, it was easy for me to explain the credibility of RSA system for my colleagues. Also, I tested a lot of applications of digital signing and reported for my chief the security issues of Shodoo (application developed by Labor Regional Court) that it led to the prohibition of use this applications at that office. Besides, I develop and test a lot of automation scripts for technical support to make easy incident handling.</p>

					<h1>Freelancer at Workana and Other Clients, Workana and Others</h1>
					<h2>Jan 2014 &mdash; Jul 2018</h2>
					<p>As a fullstack developer, I was responsible for everything in the projects. Because of this, the mainly challenge was to optimize my work by writing a clean and reusable code. The high cohesion low coupling principle led me to improve my OOP thinking and developed my own framework. Moreover, I worked with a variety of projects, like mobile, webservices, marketing, ERP, CRM, WordPress Plugins and others, in social, educational, events and health areas.</p>
